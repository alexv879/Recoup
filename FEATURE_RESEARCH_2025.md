## Freemium Pricing Best Practices (2025 Research)

### Core Principles

**1. Free Tier Should Be Genuinely Useful**
- "Offer enough value in your free plan to be genuinely useful, but hold back key features that solve bigger problems" - Maxio Research 2025
- Free users should accomplish real work, not just "try" the product
- Wave's success: Unlimited invoices, clients, expense tracking, accounting

**2. Limit by Usage, Not Features**
```
❌ BAD: "Free tier has no expense tracking"
✅ GOOD: "Free tier: Track up to 50 expenses/month"

❌ BAD: "Free tier has no time tracking"
✅ GOOD: "Free tier: Track time for up to 3 projects"

❌ BAD: "Free tier has no reports"
✅ GOOD: "Free tier: Basic reports, Premium has advanced forecasting"
```

**3. Clear Value Ladder**
- Free → Starter → Professional → Business
- Each tier should have 3-5 differentiating features
- Pricing should feel fair ($0 → $9 → $19 → $49 typical)

**4. Transparency**
- No dark patterns
- Clear upgrade paths
- No surprise limitations
- Easy to understand what's included

**5. Community & Support**
- Free tier: Community support + knowledge base
