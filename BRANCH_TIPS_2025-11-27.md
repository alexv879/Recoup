# BRANCH_TIPS_2025-11-27

This file is an archival snapshot of branch heads as of 2025-11-27 and is intended to support a safe branch cleanup.

Purpose:
- Record the branch names and last known HEAD commit SHA to support recovery if any branches are deleted.
- Provide context for why a branch may be deleted or preserved.

Important notes:
- Before deleting any branch, run the checks described in the `Cleanup Guidance` section below to verify whether the branch contains unique, unmerged work.
- If you find an active branch with unmerged work, preserve it or create an issue to track the outstanding work.

## Branch tips (partial listing from scanning earlier)

| Branch | Last-known HEAD SHA | Note / Reason |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| main | 360b8a35fde32f81... | Stable main; includes merged landing page change (PR #1).
| feat/landing-page-update-2025-11-27 | 7853e539cd75ceda... | Landing page changes merged to main (safe to delete).
| _noop | 360b8a35fde32f81... | No difference from `main` — created as a PR validation test (safe to delete).
| golden | 07ecf3e7... | Integration branch used for consolidation – preserve or review before deletion.
| thirsty-sammet | 3db7fb10... | CRO optimizations; keep if still active.

### Sample `claude/*` branches (candidates for archive/deletion; verify before action)
- claude/freelancer-revenue-saas-013NV8uMwoU5LnAPUaNWpxLU — (contains financial/Clerk integration & production readiness documentation) — last-significant SHAs include e17efab6 and 2b9e4492; verify whether work is merged.
- claude/onboarding-ux-improvements-015X6WHYkfWx2GByAmEayVbu — onboarding UX changes; verify final merge state.
- claude/security-audit-hardening-01GPLhvz... — security hardening (AES encryption, input validation); verify merged status and keep if needed.
- claude/python-codebase-refactor-0143... — Python/FastAPI migration code; ensure this was integrated or preserved elsewhere before deleting.
- More `claude/*` branches exist — these appear to be ephemeral feature branches used by CI/AI tooling and are likely candidates for deletion if merged.

## Cleanup Guidance (before deleting any branch)
1. Check if there are any unique commits not in `main`: `git fetch origin && git log origin/main..origin/<branch>` — if output is non-empty, the branch contains unmerged commits and should be preserved or audited.
2. Ensure long-lived branches are preserved (e.g., `main`, `golden`, `thirsty-sammet`).
3. If a branch contains important unmerged changes, either preserve it or create a follow-up issue describing the outstanding work and the branch owner.
4. After the archive branch (`archive/branch-tips-2025-11-27`) is pushed, create a cleanup PR listing branches proposed for deletion, referencing this file for recovery.

## Post-cleanup validation
- Run CI & smoke tests on `main` after deleting branches.
- If CI fails or missing features are discovered, use this archive branch to recover the last commit SHAs for the branches and restore them.
