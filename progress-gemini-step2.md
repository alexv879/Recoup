## Checkpoint 7: Refine `reminder-day30.txt` Email Template

**File:** `d:\RelaySoftware\relay\lib\email-templates\reminder-day30.txt`

**Description:** Updated the 30-day reminder email template for a more professional tone and improved clarity. The subject and header are more formal, and the section on statutory rights is rephrased to be clearer about the potential for additional charges, encouraging prompt payment.
