# B2B SaaS Content Marketing Strategy – Relay (Invoicing/Fintech)

## PART 1: CONTENT STRATEGY FOUNDATION

### Strategic Framework[74][75][78][81]

B2B SaaS content marketing success requires three core pillars:

1. **Full-funnel content strategy:** Content at awareness (blog), consideration (guides/case studies), and decision (comparisons/templates) stages[78]
2. **Quality over quantity:** Google now rewards helpful, authoritative content with E-E-A-T signals (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)[76]
3. **Distribution alignment:** 91% of marketers use content marketing, but success comes from strategic distribution, not just creation[78]

**Expected ROI:** Companies that blog regularly generate 67% more leads per month on average, and webinars generate up to 73% higher-quality leads for SaaS brands[78].

## PART 2: BLOG CONTENT TYPES FOR RELAY

### 1. How-To Guides (Top-of-Funnel Awareness)

**Content Type:** Educational, SEO-optimized long-form guides (2,500-4,000 words)

**Purpose:** Attract freelancers searching for solutions to cash flow, late payment, and invoicing problems

**Examples for Relay:**

| Title | Target Keyword | Length | SEO Intent |
|-------|---|---|---|

**Format & Structure (SEO Best Practices):[76][89]**

- H2 sections: 7-12 main sections (step-by-step or topic-based)
- Visual elements: Screenshots, diagrams, tables (especially process diagrams)

## PART 3: CONTENT PILLAR & CLUSTER ARCHITECTURE

### Pillar Page Strategy (SEO Topical Authority)[89][92]

**Core Principle:** Build one "pillar" page per major topic, then create 8-12 supporting "cluster" articles that link back to pillar (strengthens SEO authority)[89][92].

**Suggested Pillar Pages for Relay:**

| Pillar Topic | Focus | Target Keyword | Supporting Cluster Articles (8-12 each) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Invoice Collections** | Complete guide to getting paid | "invoice collections guide" | "Automated payment reminders" / "Legal late payment interest" / "Collections agency alternatives" / "DIY vs automated collections" |
| **Late Payment Solutions** | How to prevent/recover from late payments | "how to deal with late payments" | "Payment term contracts" / "Dispute resolution" / "Cash flow management" / "Small claims court UK" |
| **Freelance Payment Systems** | Payment methods, automation, best practices | "freelance payment systems" | "Invoice software comparison" / "Payment reminders" / "Automated invoicing" / "Payment tracking" |
| **Business Cash Flow** | Managing cash as self-employed | "cash flow management freelancers" | "Invoice timing strategies" / "Payment forecasting" / "Emergency fund building" |

### Cluster Content Strategy[89][92]

**For each pillar, create 8-12 focused articles that:**
1. Answer specific sub-questions
2. Link back to pillar with consistent anchor text
3. Link to related cluster articles
4. Use internal linking structure to show topical authority

**Example Cluster Structure: Invoice Collections Pillar**

```
PILLAR PAGE: "The Ultimate Guide to Invoice Collections" (4,000 words)
  ├─ Links to → Cluster 1: "How to Use Automated Payment Reminders" (1,500 words)
  ├─ Links to → Cluster 2: "Legal Right to Charge Late Payment Interest" (1,200 words)
  ├─ Links to → Cluster 3: "Invoice Collection Software Comparison" (2,000 words)
  ├─ Links to → Cluster 4: "DIY Collections vs. Collection Agencies" (1,800 words)
  ├─ Links to → Cluster 5: "Payment Dispute Resolution Guide" (1,500 words)
  ├─ Links to → Cluster 6: "How to Write a Collections Email" (1,000 words)
  ├─ Links to → Cluster 7: "Small Claims Court for Unpaid Invoices UK" (1,600 words)
  ├─ Links to → Cluster 8: "Client Payment Terms & Contracts" (1,400 words)
  └─ Links to → Case Studies (3-5 customer stories supporting methodology)

INTERNAL LINKING PATTERN:
- Pillar → All clusters (explicit links in table of contents)
- Cluster → Pillar (every cluster links back with anchor text "invoice collections guide")
- Cluster → Related clusters (cross-links where contextually relevant)
```

**SEO Benefit:[92]**
- Search engines recognize you as topical authority
- Pillar page ranks for primary keyword ("invoice collections")
- Cluster pages rank for long-tail keywords (fewer searches, easier to rank)
- Breadcrumb navigation reinforces information architecture

**Content Mix (Ranked by Performance):[94][98]**

| Content Type | Example | Frequency | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|

**LinkedIn Content Examples:**

**Post 1: Data-Driven Insight**
```
"45% of UK freelancers say they're waiting for payments right now.

That's not normal. That's a crisis.

Here's what it costs:
→ £21,400 average amount owed per freelancer
→ 56 million hours/year of lost productivity
→ Mental health impact (can't sleep)
→ Delayed growth (can't invest, hire, or scale)

The good news? This is fixable. 80% of late payments can be recovered within 
30 days of action.

If you're owed money and don't know what to do next, here's where to start:

```

**Post 2: How-To Thread**
```
"If a client hasn't paid 3 days after the due date, you need to act.

Here's the exact email template I use (and it works):

[THREAD FORMAT - Build as carousel/multi-part post]

1/ Subject: "Quick question on invoice [#]?"
→ Non-accusatory opening
→ References specific invoice
→ Implies they may have forgotten (gives them an out)

2/ Body:
"Hi [Name],

Just checking in on invoice [#] from [date]. 
Should have been paid by [due date].

Is there anything on my end I can help with? 

Let me know 👍"

→ Casual tone
→ No aggression
→ Offers to help

3/ Timing: Send at 9am Monday (people check email first thing)

Result: 70% response within 3 days

What email approach works best for you? 🧵 [3/3]"
