## COMMON CONTENT MARKETING MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Over-publishing without strategy** – Random content doesn't convert
✅ **Focus:** Build pillar pages + cluster architecture

❌ **Ignoring SEO** – Writing for readers, not search engines
✅ **Focus:** Keyword research before writing

❌ **Too promotional** – "Buy Relay" content killed engagement
✅ **Focus:** 80% educational, 20% promotional

❌ **No distribution plan** – Build it and they won't come
✅ **Focus:** Repurpose content across 3-4 channels

❌ **Forgetting email** – Blog traffic isn't yours if no email list
✅ **Focus:** Email signup CTA on every blog post

❌ **Not measuring results** – No data = no optimization
✅ **Focus:** Track views, leads, conversions per article

❌ **One-time content** – Blog post published, never touched again
✅ **Focus:** Update/refresh top 10 articles quarterly
