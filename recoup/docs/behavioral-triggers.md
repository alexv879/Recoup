# Behavioral Trigger Email Templates – Relay

## BEHAVIORAL EMAIL FRAMEWORK

Behavioral emails outperform time-based campaigns by 30-50%[53][54]. They trigger based on specific user actions (or inactions), making each message feel timely and relevant.

---

## TRIGGER 1: INCOMPLETE INVOICE CREATION

**Trigger:** User opens Email 1 or Email 2 but doesn't create an invoice within 24 hours

**Sender:** Alex from Relay

**Timing:** Day 2, 10am (if no invoice created)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Need help creating your first invoice?"
- "[Quick] One thing holding you back?"
- "Invoice creation is this easy 👇"

---

### TRIGGER 1 EMAIL COPY

```
Subject: Need help creating your first invoice?

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to check in.

You opened my email yesterday, but I haven't seen you create an invoice yet.

Sometimes it's not clear where to start. So here's the exact path:

1. Click "New Invoice" in the dashboard
2. Type [Client Name] (optional – you can add later)
3. Type the amount you're owed
4. Click "Send"

That's it. Takes 2 minutes max.

[CTA BUTTON] Create Your First Invoice

Or, if you have a question:
→ Reply to this email (I read everything)
→ Book a quick call with me [link]

I want to make sure you experience the value of Relay before your 14-day 
trial ends.

Best,
Alex
```

## TRIGGER 2: INVOICE CREATED BUT NOT SENT

**Trigger:** User creates invoice but doesn't send to client within 24 hours

**Sender:** Alex from Relay

**Timing:** Day 1 after invoice creation, 2pm

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Your invoice is ready to send 📤"
- "Last step: Send your invoice to [Client Name]"
- "Almost there! Send your invoice and we'll help"

---

### TRIGGER 2 EMAIL COPY

```
Subject: Your invoice is ready to send 📤

Hi [First Name],

Great news – you created an invoice for [Client Name] for £[amount]!

One more step: send it.

[CTA BUTTON] Send Invoice Now

Once you send it, Relay takes over:
→ Tracks if it gets opened
→ Sends automatic reminders if unpaid
→ Alerts you if there's a dispute

This is where the magic starts.

[CTA BUTTON] Send Invoice Now

Best,
Alex

P.S. – If the client disputes payment, Relay helps you recover it. That's the whole point.
```

---

## TRIGGER 3: INVOICE OVERDUE (SOFT UPSELL)

**Trigger:** Invoice due date passed + invoice still unpaid

**Sender:** Alex from Relay

**Timing:** Day 1 after due date, 9am

**Subject Line Options:**
- "£[amount] from [Client Name] is now overdue 📢"
- "Your invoice is overdue – Relay can help"
- "Time to send a payment reminder"

---

### TRIGGER 3 EMAIL COPY

```
Subject: £[amount] from [Client Name] is now overdue 📢

Hi [First Name],

Your invoice to [Client Name] (£[amount]) was due yesterday.

Usually, this is where you send a manual reminder. You know – the awkward email 
"Hey, just checking in on that invoice..."

But what if Relay handled it automatically?

WITH RELAY PRO:
✓ Invoice overdue → SMS reminder sent automatically
✓ 3 days later → Reminder call from Relay's team
✓ Still unpaid → Relay's dispute resolution team steps in
✓ Result → You get paid (86% success rate)

This is exactly why we built Pro.

[CTA BUTTON] Try Relay Pro Free (7 Days)

Or, send a manual reminder now:
[CTA BUTTON] Send Reminder to [Client Name]

The difference between Pro and Free:
→ Free: You do the chasing
→ Pro: Relay does it for you

Best,
Alex

P.S. – 86% of our Pro users get paid even when the client initially said "no."
```

---

## TRIGGER 4: NO LOGIN IN 7 DAYS (RE-ENGAGEMENT)

**Trigger:** User hasn't logged in for 7+ days after signup

**Sender:** Alex from Relay

**Timing:** Day 8, 10am

**Subject Line Options:**
- "We miss you! [New feature you should see]"
- "Your invoices are waiting for protection"
- "What's new in Relay (and why to come back)"

---

### TRIGGER 4 EMAIL COPY

```
Subject: We miss you! Here's what's changed in Relay

Hi [First Name],

You haven't logged into Relay since [Day].

---

## TRIGGER 6: TRIAL EXPIRED (FINAL REMINDER)

**Trigger:** Trial expired 24 hours ago + user hasn't upgraded

**Sender:** Alex from Relay

**Timing:** Day 15 (if 14-day trial), 10am

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Your Relay trial expired. What's next?"
- "£[amount] in unpaid invoices waiting for protection"
- "Relay Pro is now active – here's how to access it"

---

### TRIGGER 6 EMAIL COPY

```
Subject: Your Relay trial expired. Here's what you need to know.

Hi [First Name],

Your Relay free trial expired yesterday.

Your account is still active, but you've lost access to Pro features:
✗ SMS reminders now off
✗ Automatic payment calls now off
✗ Dispute recovery now off

But you still have:
✓ Basic email reminders (free forever)
✓ Manual invoice tracking
✓ Dashboard access

Here's what I want you to know: Most freelancers who switch to Pro end up getting 
paid 2X faster. That means fewer sleepless nights chasing payments.

Ready to get that peace of mind back?

[CTA BUTTON] Upgrade to Pro – First Month Free

Or, keep using Free (totally fine):
[CTA BUTTON] Continue With Free Plan

The cost of Pro (£9.99/month) is less than one overdue invoice. Just saying.

Best,
Alex

P.S. – If you have questions about Pro or need help, I'm here. Just reply to 
this email.
```

## TRIGGER 7: CHURN RISK (INACTIVE USER)

**Trigger:** 30+ days since last login + no invoices sent

**Sender:** Alex from Relay

**Timing:** Day 31 of inactivity, 10am

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Come back to Relay – here's why"
- "We want to make this easier for you"
- "Your feedback wanted 💬"

---

### TRIGGER 7 EMAIL COPY

```
Subject: Come back to Relay – here's why

Hi [First Name],

You signed up for Relay a month ago, and I haven't seen you back since.

That tells me one of two things:
1. You're all set (clients are paying on time, no disputes)
2. Something didn't work for you

If it's #1 – congrats! That's the dream.

If it's #2 – I want to know. Was it:
→ Confusing to set up?
→ Didn't see the value?
→ Found a better solution?
→ Just haven't gotten around to it?

Whatever it is, tell me. Your feedback helps us build something better.

[CTA LINK] Tell me what happened

Or, if you want to try again, I'll walk you through it:

[CTA BUTTON] Schedule a Demo with Me (15 min)

No pressure. Just want to make sure you know what Relay can do.

Best,
Alex
Founder, Relay

P.S. – Over the last month, Relay users recovered £342K in unpaid invoices. 
If you're struggling to get paid, let's talk.

## TRIGGER 8: USAGE MILESTONE (CELEBRATION)

**Trigger:** User creates 10th invoice

**Sender:** Alex from Relay

**Timing:** Immediately upon milestone

**Subject Line Options:**
- "🎉 You just hit 10 invoices! Here's what Pro adds"
- "Your invoices are protected! (But Pro makes it even better)"
- "10 invoices & counting – now try Pro"

---

### TRIGGER 8 EMAIL COPY

```
Subject: 🎉 You've created 10 invoices! Here's what's next.

Hi [First Name],

Congratulations – you've created 10 invoices using Relay!

That's fantastic. It means you're actively protecting your work.

But here's the thing: If even ONE of those invoices gets disputed or goes unpaid, 
Relay Free can help, but only so much.

Relay Pro changes the game:

WITH PRO:
→ Automatic SMS reminders (3x better response rate than email)
→ Payment calls (Relay actually calls your clients)
→ Dispute resolution (Relay's team fights for you)
→ Success rate: 86% of disputed invoices recovered

REAL IMPACT:
If you've sent £10,000 in invoices, Pro costs £99/year to protect all of it.

That's protecting £10K for the price of one overdue invoice.

[CTA BUTTON] Try Relay Pro Free for 7 Days

Best,
Alex

P.S. – Our data shows that Pro users recover £2-5K on average per year. 
What's that worth to you?
```

## BEST PRACTICES FOR BEHAVIORAL EMAILS

1. **Personalization:** Always include [Client Name], [Amount], or [Action User Took][57]
2. **Specificity:** Reference exact behavior: "You created an invoice" vs. "Your account is ready"[57]
3. **Urgency without pressure:** Use "48 hours left" not "DO THIS NOW"[53]
4. **Single CTA:** One primary action per email; secondary CTA is optional[35]
5. **Tone:** Stay friendly, helpful, never pushy[54]
6. **Frequency cap:** Don't send more than 1 behavioral trigger per user per day[53]
7. **Segmentation:** Use user metadata (plan, activity level) to segment triggers[35]
