<!-- Behavioral Trigger 1: Incomplete Invoice Creation -->
Subject: Need help creating your first invoice?

Hi {{firstName}},

I wanted to check in.
You opened my email yesterday, but I haven't seen you create an invoice yet.

Sometimes it's not clear where to start. So here's the exact path:
1. Click "New Invoice" in the dashboard
2. Type [Client Name] (optional – you can add later)
3. Type the amount you're owed
4. Click "Send"

That's it. Takes 2 minutes max.

[CTA BUTTON] Create Your First Invoice

Or, if you have a question:
→ Reply to this email (I read everything)
→ Book a quick call with me [link]

I want to make sure you experience the value of Relay before your 14-day trial ends.

Best,
Alex
