<!-- Behavioral Trigger 2: Invoice Created but Not Sent -->
Subject: Your invoice is ready to send 📤

Hi {{firstName}},

Great news – you created an invoice for {{clientName}} for £{{amount}}!

One more step: send it.

Once you send it, Relay takes over:
→ Tracks if it gets opened
→ Sends automatic reminders if unpaid
→ Alerts you if there's a dispute

This is where the magic starts.

Best,

P.S. – If the client disputes payment, Relay helps you recover it. That's the whole point.
