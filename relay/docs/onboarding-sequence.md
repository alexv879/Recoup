- **Reduce cognitive load:** Break into digestible steps (4 steps max per email)[35]
- **One CTA:** Only the "Create Your First Invoice" button drives action[35]
- **Accessibility fallback:** Provide text description of each screenshot (for accessibility)

---

### EMAIL 2 METRICS TARGETS[39][51]

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Open Rate** | 40-50% |
| **Click Rate** | 5-8% |
| **Conversion (Invoice Created)** | 20-30% of recipients |

## EMAIL 4: FEATURE HIGHLIGHT (Day 7)

**Subject Line Options:**

- "Your invoices just got smarter"

**Sender Name:** "Alex from Relay"

**Send Timing:** Triggered by: Day 7 from signup OR if invoice created (progressive feature education)

---

### EMAIL 4 COPY

```
Subject: What happens when your invoice goes overdue?

Hi [First Name],

Here's a problem I hear a lot from freelancers:

"My client isn't paying. I've reminded them 3 times. Now what?"

Relay solves this automatically.

HOW IT WORKS:
→ You create an invoice
→ Client doesn't pay by due date
→ Relay sends 3 automatic reminders (no work from you)
→ If client still doesn't pay, Relay's recovery team steps in
→ You get your money back (even if the client argues)

This is why you pay for Pro. Here's what Pro includes:

✓ SMS reminders (texts work better than emails)
✓ AI-powered payment calls (Relay calls the client for you)
✓ Collections support (we fight for you if they dispute)
✓ Weekly reports (see your cash flow)

The best part? Relay's recovery team has 86% success rate.

See Pro features in action:
[CTA BUTTON] View Pro Features & Pricing

Or keep using free & test it first:
[CTA BUTTON] Create Another Invoice (Free)

Best,
Alex
```

---

### EMAIL 4 STRATEGIC NOTES

- **Feature education:** Explain the problem first, then the feature[35]
- **Hint at paid features:** Introduce Pro without hard sell (day 7 is too early for aggressive upsell)[41]
- **Benefit, not features:** Focus on "86% recovery rate" (benefit) vs. "automated reminders" (feature)[33]
- **Dual CTAs:** Let user continue with free plan (low-pressure) or explore Pro (conversions path)

---

## EMAIL 5: SOFT UPGRADE PROMPT (Day 14)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Get paid 2X faster with Relay Pro"
- "Your free trial ends in 7 days. Here's what you unlock."
- "£5K+ freelancers don't risk client disputes. You shouldn't either."

**Sender Name:** "Alex from Relay"

**Send Timing:** Day 14 (free trial ending) OR if invoice sent + 7 days passed

---

### EMAIL 5 COPY

```
Subject: Get paid 2X faster with Relay Pro

Hi [First Name],

Your free trial ends in 7 days.

Here's what you get if you upgrade to Pro:

PRO FEATURES ($9.99/month):
✓ SMS reminders (3x better response rate)
✓ AI payment calls (Relay calls clients for you)
✓ Priority dispute support (get paid even if client argues)
✓ Weekly cash flow reports
✓ 86% invoice recovery success rate

REAL RESULT:
Freelancers using Pro get paid 2X faster than those using free.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:
If you're typically owed £1,000 at any time, Pro saves you:
→ 2-3 weeks per year waiting for payment
→ Stress about "will they pay?"
→ Risk of losing clients over payment disputes

Ready to stop chasing payments?

---

### EMAIL 5 STRATEGIC NOTES[38][41]

- **Soft upsell, not aggressive:** Include "continue with free" option (reduces unsubscribe)[38]
- **Quantify value:** "Paid 2X faster" + "Save 2-3 weeks" (specific benefits)[33][35]
- **Multiple CTAs:** Upgrade → Free → Talk to Sales (let user choose path)[35]
- **Trial expiration urgency:** "7 days" creates gentle urgency without pressure[39]

## PART 2: EMAIL DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

### Plain Text vs HTML for Freemium Onboarding[42][43][44][46]

**Research Findings:**

1. **Plain text emails outperform HTML:**
   - Plain text: 21-42% higher click-through rate[44]
   - Plain text: 25-42% higher open rate (when comparing to heavy HTML)[49]
   - Plain text: Drop in opens of 23-37% when images added to HTML[42][43]

2. **Why plain text wins for onboarding:**[46]
   - Looks more personal ("handwritten feel")[44]
   - Better deliverability (avoids spam filters)
   - Less distraction from main message
   - Mobile-friendly (renders perfectly on all devices)
   - Founder emails feel more authentic[47]

3. **When to use HTML (secondary use):**
   - Branded promotional emails (day-14 upgrade email)
   - When aesthetic consistency matters more than conversion
   - If audience already expects HTML design

**Recommendation for Relay:** Use plain text for emails 1-3 (onboarding/education), light HTML for email 5 (upgrade, branded).

---

### Sender Name Impact on Open Rates[47][50]

**Research Finding: Sender name is 42% of the open decision[50]**

According to Litmus-Fluent survey, email recipients prioritize sender name (42%) before subject line (34%) and preview text (24%) when deciding to open.

**Case Study: Voices.com[47]**
- Before: "hello@brandname.com" → 28.7% open rate
- After: "Benjamin (Voices.com)" → 43.63% open rate
- **Lift: +51.8% increase in opens**

**Optimal Sender Name Formats (Ranked):**

| Rank | Format | Example | When to Use |
|------|--------|---------|---|
| 1 | **[First Name] from [Brand]** | "Alex from Relay" | Onboarding (emails 1-4) |
| 2 | **[First Name] ([Brand])** | "Alex (Relay)" | Founder message / high-value |
| 3 | **[Brand] + [First Name]** | "Relay – Alex" | Mixed approach (branded + personal) |
| 4 | **[First Name] [Last Name]** | "Alex Vasile" | Personal outreach (sales follow-up) |
| 5 | **[Brand] Team** | "Relay Team" | Lower priority emails / updates |
| ❌ | **noreply@[brand].com** | "noreply@relay.com" | Avoid – lowest open rates |

**Recommendation for Relay:**
- Email 1-4: "Alex from Relay" (maximize opens during critical onboarding)
- Email 5: Alternate between "Alex from Relay" (first send) and "Relay Team" (resend), or keep "Alex" for consistency

---

### Email Template Structure (Plain Text Example)

```
From: Alex from Relay <alex@relay.co.uk>
Subject: [Subject line - max 50 characters]
Preview Text: [Preview - 40-60 characters, summary of email]

────────────────────────────────────

[Unsubscribe link]
```

## PART 3: BEHAVIORAL TRIGGERS & EVENT-BASED EMAILS

### Behavioral Trigger Strategy[52][53][54][57][59]

Behavioral trigger emails outperform time-based drip campaigns. Instead of sending all emails on a fixed schedule, send emails based on user actions (or lack of action).

**Key Principle:** Trigger-based emails yield significantly better engagement rates[35]

---

### Relay Behavioral Triggers

| User Behavior | Trigger Email | Timing | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Signup complete** | Welcome email | Immediate | Establish context |
| **No email open in 24h** | Re-send Email 1 or Email 2 | Day 2 | Re-engagement |
| **Email opened but no invoice by Day 2** | Tutorial email (Email 2) | Day 2 | Lower friction |
| **Invoice created** | Skip to Email 4 (Features) | Immediately | Progress user |
| **Day 7 from signup** | Feature email (Email 4) | Day 7 | Educate on Pro |
| **Invoice created but not sent to client** | "Finish sending your invoice" | Day 1 after creation | Nudge to complete |
| **Invoice sent but still unpaid by Day 5** | "Your invoice is overdue – send reminder" | Day 5 | Soft upsell to Pro (automation) |
| **Day 14 from signup** | Upgrade email (Email 5) | Day 14 | Drive conversion |
| **Free trial ending in 48 hours** | "Your free trial ends soon" | Day 13 | Final urgency |

---

### Example Trigger Emails (Beyond Main Sequence)

#### TRIGGER: Invoice Created But Not Sent

```
Subject: Quick question: did you forget to send that invoice?

Hi [First Name],

I see you created an invoice for [Client Name] for £[amount] – nice work!

One thing: it hasn't been sent to the client yet.

[CTA BUTTON] Send Invoice to [Client Name]

This takes 10 seconds, and then Relay starts helping you get paid.

Best,
Alex
```

**Why it works:** Removes friction for incomplete action; references specific invoice (personalization)[57]

---

#### TRIGGER: Invoice Overdue (Soft Upsell to Pro)

```
Subject: Your invoice from [Client Name] is overdue – send a reminder?

Hi [First Name],

Your invoice to [Client Name] (£[amount]) is now [X days] overdue.

Normally this is where you manually send a reminder. But with Relay Pro, 
it happens automatically:

✓ Auto-reminder sent immediately
✓ If unpaid in 3 days, SMS reminder sent
✓ If still unpaid, Relay's team steps in

Want to stop chasing payments manually?

[CTA BUTTON] Try Relay Pro Free for 7 Days

Or, send manual reminder:
[CTA BUTTON] Send Reminder Now (Free)

Best,
Alex
```

**Why it works:** Tied to real user pain point (overdue invoice); presents upgrade as solution[57][59]

---

#### TRIGGER: User Inactive (No Login in 7 Days)

```
Subject: We miss you! Here's what changed in Relay

Hi [First Name],

You haven't logged into Relay in a week. 

Here's what you might've missed:

→ Easier invoice reminders (see how)
→ Integration with Stripe (auto-import invoices)
→ New FAQ: "When should I upgrade to Pro?" (read)

Your invoices still need protection. Want to get back in?

[CTA BUTTON] Log Into Relay

Questions? I'm here to help:
[CTA BUTTON] Book a 15-Min Call With Me

Best,
Alex
```

**Why it works:** Light re-engagement; shows new features (incentive to return); low-pressure CTA[57][59]
