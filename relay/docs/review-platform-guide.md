## COLLECTION & INCENTIVE STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Organic Collection (Week 1-4)
**Target:** 15-20 reviews from most satisfied customers (no incentive)

**Email approach:**
- Send personal outreach to customers who recovered £3K+
- Emphasize: "Your story helps other freelancers"
- Link directly to G2 review form
- No incentive mentioned

**Expected:** 5-8 reviews (25-40% response rate)

---

### Phase 2: Incentivized Collection (Week 5-12)
**Target:** 30-50 reviews using nominal incentives

**G2 Campaign:**
- Use G2's official "Incentive Link" from vendor dashboard
- Offer: £10 Amazon gift card
- Message: "Leave an honest review, get £10 (5-star & 2-star reviews equally rewarded)"
- Expected: 20-30 reviews
- Cost: £200-300

**Capterra Campaign:**
- Use Capterra's official incentive program (Amazon gift cards)
- Offer: Same as G2
- Expected: 10-15 reviews
- Cost: £100-150

---

### Phase 3: Sustained Collection (Month 3+)
**Ongoing cadence:**
- Monthly outreach to new customers (Day 30 of account)
- Rotation: 1 month organic → 1 month incentivized
- Target: 10-15 new reviews per month

---

## COMPLIANCE & FTC DISCLOSURE

### What's Required:

✅ **Clearly label incentivized reviews** – Both G2 and Capterra require "Reviewer Source" badges  
✅ **Offer incentive equally** – Cannot pay only for 5-star reviews  
✅ **Keep under $25 USD** – This is the "nominal" threshold for FTC compliance  
✅ **Document incentive offers** – Report to compliance teams if using external incentive links  
✅ **Disclose in customer communications** – Email clearly states reviews will be marked as incentivized  

### What's Prohibited:

❌ **Pay for specific sentiment** – Cannot say "£10 for a 5-star review"  
❌ **Selective incentivization** – Cannot offer £10 to some customers, nothing to others  
❌ **Exceed nominal value** – Cannot offer £50+ per review  
❌ **Hide incentive status** – Must use platform-provided disclosure badges  
❌ **Target specific reviewer types** – Cannot screen based on expected rating
