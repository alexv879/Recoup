## SENDER NAME IMPACT RESEARCH

**Key Finding:** Sender name drives 42% of open decision[50]

| Sender Format | Expected Open Rate | Usage Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **Alex from Relay** | 50-60% | ✅ Best – use for onboarding (Emails 1-4) |
| **Alex (Relay)** | 48-55% | ✅ Good – alternative |
| **Relay Team** | 40-45% | ⚠️ Use only after Email 5 |
| **noreply@relay.com** | 28-35% | ❌ Avoid – kills open rates |

## HTML VS PLAIN TEXT DECISION

### When to Use Plain Text

✅ Onboarding (Emails 1-4): Plain text wins
✅ Behavioral triggers: Plain text for authenticity
✅ Educational/how-to emails: Plain text recommended
✅ Founder/personal messages: Plain text essential

### When to Use Light HTML

⚠️ Only for Email 5 (upgrade prompt) – can add brand elements
⚠️ If company branding critical
⚠️ For promotional campaigns (not onboarding)

### The Numbers[42][43][49]

- Plain text: **25-42% higher open rates** than HTML
- Plain text: **21-51% higher click rates** than HTML with images
- Images in HTML: **23-37% drop in opens**
- GIFs in HTML: **42% drop in opens**

## FOUNDER EMAIL PRINCIPLES

From Relay's perspective, emails from "Alex from Relay" should feel like personal communication, not corporate marketing. Key principles:

✅ Be helpful first, promotional second
✅ Acknowledge customer pain ("I know you're busy")
✅ Show vulnerability ("I want to make sure everything works for you")
✅ Make it easy to reply ("Reply to this email – I read everything")
✅ Respect their time (keep it short)
✅ Focus on their win, not your sale

**Example:**

```
Subject: Need help creating your first invoice?

Hi Sarah,

I haven't seen you create an invoice yet in Relay.

Sometimes the first step is confusing, so I wanted to help.

Here's exactly where to click: [link]

If you get stuck, just reply. I'll walk you through it personally.

Best,
Alex
```

This feels like help from a real person, not a marketing machine.
