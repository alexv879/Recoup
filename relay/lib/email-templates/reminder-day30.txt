📋 YOUR RIGHTS UNDER UK LAW
============================

Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998

As the creditor, I am legally entitled to claim:

Statutory Interest: £{{statutory_interest}}

Fixed Compensation Fee: £{{fixed_compensation}}
  ({{fixed_fee_tier}})

PLEASE NOTE: This calculation is provided for informational purposes. I have the right to claim this amount under UK law, but the decision to do so is mine. This does not constitute automatic addition to your invoice.


⚖️ NEXT STEPS IF PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED
==========================================

If full payment of the original invoice amount (£{{amount}}) is not received within 14 days of this notice, I may pursue one or more of the following actions:

• Claim the statutory interest and fixed compensation fee detailed above
• Report this debt to credit reference agencies
• Instruct a debt collection agency
• Commence legal proceedings to recover the debt
• Apply for a County Court Judgment (CCJ)

These actions will incur additional costs, which you will be liable for.
